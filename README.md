# Churn Rate Application

The **Churn Rate Application** is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload a dataset (in CSV or Excel format) to analyze and predict customer churn. The application uses a machine learning model built with Python and scikit-learn for the prediction and displays a dynamic 3D grid background powered by Three.js.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Prediction:**  
  Upload your dataset and the application will process it using a trained RandomForestClassifier model (or train a new one if necessary) to predict the churn rate.
  
- **Dynamic 3D Background:**  
  The landing page features an interactive, Three.js-powered grid background that changes on user interaction.

- **File Upload Interface:**  
  A simple and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap allows users to upload their dataset easily.
